`which-key` is an Atom package that displays the key bindings and their respective commands following your currently entered incomplete command (a prefix) in a pane. For example, after enabling the package, if you enter `ctrl-k`/`cmd-k` and wait for the default of half second, the panel will expand with all of the available key bindings that follow `ctrl-k`/`cmd-k`.
